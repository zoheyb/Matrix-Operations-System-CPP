# Matrix Operations System (MOS) 🧮

A robust C++ console application designed to handle complex linear algebra operations. This project demonstrates the implementation of 2D arrays, modular programming, and algorithm logic for matrix calculations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Addition & Subtraction:** Includes dimension validation to ensure matrices can mathematically be computed.
- **Matrix Multiplication:** Implements $O(n^3)$ logic to handle row-by-column multiplication.
- **Transpose:** Dynamically swaps rows and columns.
- **Interactive UI:** Clean, ASCII-based menu interface for easy navigation.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts
- **Language:** C++
- **Data Structures:** 2D Arrays
- **Logic:** Nested Loops, Conditional Statements, Modular Functions (Switch-Case)

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `main.cpp` in any C++ compiler (DevC++, VS Code, CodeBlocks).
3. Compile and Run.
4. Follow the on-screen menu instructions.
